# Issues
* Priority rules are for operators not following spec
* Print the specific tokens for the tree, not just "statement" or "expression".
* Rep causes double nodes
* if should be able to handle multiple statements eg: if (num < 1 && num > 100 || !num)


# Solved issues
* Remove unused tokens from bison.
    - Comment lacks a token and GT have been written as MT
